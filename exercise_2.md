# Sentences as Maps
## Exercise 2
### closures in Javascript

* A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

* Nouns to explore:

    - *function*
    - *lexical environment*

* **Function**: A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure - a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the two.

* **Lexical Environment**: Every time the JavaScript engine creates an execution context to execute the function or global code, it also creates a new lexical environment to store the variable defined in that function during the execution of that function. A lexical environment is a data structure that holds indentifier-variable mapping.

* Nouns to explore:

    - *execution context*

* **Execution Context**: In JavaScript, execution context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment within the which the current code is being executed. The JavaScript Engine creates the global execution context before it starts to execute any code.
