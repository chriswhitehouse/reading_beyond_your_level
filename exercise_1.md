# Sentences as Maps
## Exercise 1
### new operator in Javascript

* The `new` operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

* Nouns to explore:
    - *operator*
    - *instance*
    - *user-defined object type*
    - *built-in object type*
        - *constructor function*

* **Operator**: An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.

* **Instance**: instance of an object

* **User-defined object type**: objects the programmer has created in your programme

* **Built in object type**: provided by the JavaScript core: Things like Array, Strings, Number, Boolean, RegExp are all built in objects.

Nouns to expolore:
    - operands
    - objects

* **Operands**: Forming JavaScript sentences is called writing statements. Statements are mostly made up of operands (which are like nouns), and operators (which are like verbs).

* **Objects**: Objects are containers fro named values called properties or methods.
